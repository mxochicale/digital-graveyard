# Digitital graveyard
Very often I enjoy reading biographies of inventor(s), scientist(s) and artist(s) and I pay attention to their early days of life, education and other facts but usually I see the day of born and death which is just banished in my memory. Reason to create this repository called "digital graveyard"

See [issues](https://github.com/mxochicale/digital-graveyard/issues) where day of born and death is used for titles of such persons as well as `mob-month` and `mod-month` for month of born and month of death.
